Data Structures: Analysis and Design

The main "problem with this project was simply to go through each potential data structure and pick the best one that fits the needs of this application. While I believe a binary tree structure to be the most interesting and potentially best data structure, I ended up going with a vector data structure due to my inability to get the BST to compile without errors. The main approach that I took was to look at advantages and disadvantages to each data structure and choosing one to implement that would give a foundation for the rest of the code. I think my approach to this project made me realize that proper planning and bigger scope when viewing a potential application is incredibly important. I think that my strong suit has always been having proper coding etiquette and having clean code written with adequate comments explaining clearly what's going on. While I fell short by describing exactly everything in the program, I tried to be as descriptive as possible so that the code is easily maintainable.
